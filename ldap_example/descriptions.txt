## Programmatically add permissions:
from django.contrib.auth.models import Group, Permission

''' define a variable to contain the group, and get the group name. In this case 'django_security_group' '''
security_group, created = Group.objects.get_or_create(name='django_security_team')

''' For a single permission, get the correct permission by name. 
    Check as admin in the admin console what the name exactly is, in this case 'Can view protected object' 
'''
#pm = Permission.objects.get(name='Can view protected object')
#security_group.permissions.add(pm)

''' To get all permissions for a specific object use the filter with the objects name: 
    In this case: "protected object" .. Then loop through the result to add all permissions.
'''
all_permissions = Permission.objects.filter(name__contains='protected object')
for permission in all_permissions:
    security_group.permissions.add(permission)
